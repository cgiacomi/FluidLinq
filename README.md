# FluidLinq

FluidLinq is a small Linq extension library that makes it very easy to parse XML. 

The library is meant to be used to deserialize objects from XML. It reduces the code that needs to be written and ensures that you do not run into casting exception.


Thanks goes to [runeapetersen](https://github.com/runeapetersen) who helped convert an idea into implementation. 


## Requirements

FluidLinq requires .NET4 runtime.

The project requires Visual Studio 2010


## Installation

FluidLinq is available for download from [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/FluidLinq) or if you prefer you can download the source and compile it yourself.



## Use

Coming soon... in the mean time you can take a look at the unit tests and see how the extension methods are meant to be used.
